    <h2>Did you choose this course?</h2>
    <p><b>No</b>sir, my parents chose
        this path, and I respect their
        decision. I'm meant to be an
        aviation engineering student
        in Patts, and my ambition is
        to be a pilot, but officially,
        my father claimed that any
        course is acceptable to
        become a pilot as long as it's
        a four-year course. So i
        planed that after i graduated
        here in apc i'll continue my
        dreams and work hard for it.

        <h2>Goals in Life</h2>
        <p>My life's ambition is to
            become a pilot, therefore
            after completing a four-year
            education here in APC, I'll
            continue on my journey to
            become a pilot by enrolling
            in a flying school in Clark
            with the help of my family.
